Question 2: This question asked me to choose all of the valid logical operators. Instead, I selected the comparison operators. The correct answers were &&, ||, and !. These are the actual logical operators.

Question 4: A string is set to variable a. There are then two console.logs. One is set to print "(!a)" and the other is set to print "(!!a)" . The two !s in the second statement should cancel out to log true to the console while. The first one has only one ! so it should still log false.

Question 7: This question asked me to select a list of cases from a few possibilites that has the correct syntax. I simply chose the wrong one. The list I chose was almost entirely correct but the case numbers had quotation marks around them when they shouldn't have.

Question 9: This question asked for the simplest way to determine someone's letter grade. I chose a properly coded set of cases. However, the correct answer was an if statement that did the same thing. The If statements were the simpler method of writing the code so I got the question wrong.

Question 12: For this question, rather than get answers wrong, I only selected one of 2 correct answers. I was supposed so select all do...while loops that would work properly. For whatever reason, I felt that one of the loops (which would decrease variable x by 1 until it was less than or equal to 100) wouldn't work when it certainly would.

Question 13: This question asked me to choose the correct sequence of events for a for loop. I got two of the steps reversed. The loop body occurs before the update but I said the opposite.

Question 14: I said that anything written in a while loop couldn't be achieved by a for loop. This is false. The two are basically interchangeable and more about personal preference and meaning than actual functional difference.

Question 1: When fewer arguments are passed in than there are parameters, only the parameters that haven't recieved an argument will be undefined. Only the parameters that recieve arguments will be able to work so any parameters that don't recieve an argument simply can't do anything than return as undefined.

Question 2:   `function power(base, exponent) {/* implementation not shown */ }` would be a better code than                              `function raise(x, y) {/* implementation not shown */ }` because the variables and function name are much more descriptive. It will be easier to understand how the function works and what its purpose is.

Question 3: I said that the mystery function was designed to accept parameters while in fact, it was not. There were no variables inside of the parentheses so no arguments could be given. Without these arguments there would be no way to return a value either which I also said it would.

Question 6: Prompt was the only of the four built-in function that is designed to return a value. Console.log, alert, and math.random all transmit information for the developer or user to see, but don't return values that can then be used in the code for a purpose. Prompt allows the user to input information which can then be used by the code to carry out a task.
