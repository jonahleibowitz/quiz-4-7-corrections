Question 1: When fewer arguments are passed in than there are parameters, only the parameters that haven't recieved an argument will be undefined. Only the parameters that recieve arguments will be able to work so any parameters that don't recieve an argument simply can't do anything than return as undefined.

Question 2:   `function power(base, exponent) {/* implementation not shown */ }` would be a better code than                              `function raise(x, y) {/* implementation not shown */ }` because the variables and function name are much more descriptive. It will be easier to understand how the function works and what its purpose is.

Question 3: I said that the mystery function was designed to accept parameters while in fact, it was not. There were no variables inside of the parentheses so no arguments could be given. Without these arguments there would be no way to return a value either which I also said it would.

Question 6: Prompt was the only of the four built-in function that is designed to return a value. Console.log, alert, and math.random all transmit information for the developer or user to see, but don't return values that can then be used in the code for a purpose. Prompt allows the user to input information which can then be used by the code to carry out a task.
