## Quiz 4
Question 1: When fewer arguments are passed in than there are parameters, only the parameters that haven't recieved an argument will be undefined. Only the parameters that recieve arguments will be able to work so any parameters that don't recieve an argument simply can't do anything than return as undefined.

Question 2:   `function power(base, exponent) {/* implementation not shown */                                  /* implementation not shown */
               }`    would be a better code than function raise(x, y) {
              
               
              }
